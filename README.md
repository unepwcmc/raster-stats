============

Sinatra app to calculate intersection stats between polygons and rasters.


Start it
============

<pre><code>bundle install
shotgun config.ru</code></pre>
The application will be running in port 9393:
<code>http://localhost:9393/stats/{polygon in GeoJSON}</code>


Set up
============

Install starspan 1.2.06 or above (http://starspan.projects.atlas.ca.gov/). The 1.2.06 git repository is in https://github.com/Ecotrust/starspan. You may need GEOS <= 3.2 (http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/) and GDAL (http://www.gdal.org/) to install it.


Raster Management
======================
If you want to upload a raster from an external server:
Browse to <em>http://localhost:9393/externalupload/</em>

If you want to use a local raster:
Browse to <em>http://localhost:9393/internalupload/</em>

The rasters are split into three folders, based on their resolution: <em>high_resolution</em>,  <em> medium_resolution</em>, and <em>low_resolution</em> and it is created a json file on <em>info/</em> folder.

Example
===========

After starting the server, point your browser to:

http://localhost:9393/STATS/RASTERNAME/{"type": "FeatureCollection","features": [{ "type": "Feature", "id": 0, "properties": { "id": null, "name": 8, "AREA": 7435.85032686457 }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -55.199133830905097, 14.166474645080788 ], [ -139.868730478081005, 21.093987098031544 ], [ -166.295907613411686, 80.619279286349169 ], [ -19.022124354384474, 82.671875568704948 ], [ -55.199133830905097, 14.166474645080788 ] ] ] } }]}

Replace STATS with "avg", "sum", "max" or "min".

Replace RASTERNAME with the name of the raster file including extension.

This example uses a massive polygon, so the application will use the low resolution raster.
